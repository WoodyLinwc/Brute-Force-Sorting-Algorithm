# Brute Force Sorting Algorithm

I want to make a single java file that contains fundamental brute force sorting algorithms, so people can actually download it to the local machine and run it without any editing.

So far, I have the following sorting algorithms in the file
1. bubble sort
2. optimized bubble sort
3. insertion sort
