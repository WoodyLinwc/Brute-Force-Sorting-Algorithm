# Brute Force and Divide Conquer Sorting Algorithm

I want to make a single java file that contains fundamental sorting algorithms, so people can actually download it to the local machine and run it without any editing.

So far, I have the following sorting algorithms in the file
1. bubble sort
2. optimized bubble sort
3. heap sort 
4. insertion sort 
5. shell sort 
6. quick sort

- User can specify the array size, then the program will generate randomized array to test the runtime of algorithm.

- The program arranges the algorithm runtime from most efficient to least efficient in the command line output.
